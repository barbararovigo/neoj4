`match (p:Person) return p`  

1.4 Exercise 1.4: Retrieve all Movie nodes. (38 filmes)

2.4 Retrieve all Movies released in a specific year, returning their titles.    
`match(m:Movie{released:1995}) return m.title`  

2.5 Display title, released, and tagline values for every Movie node in the graph.   
`match(m:Movie) return m.title, m.released, m.tagline`  

2.6 Display more user-friendly headers in the table.  
`match(m:Movie) return m.title as título, m.released as lançamento, m.tagline as slogan`  

Exercício 3 - Filtering queries using relationships

`match (p:Person)-[rel:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie{title:'The Matrix'}) where p.born > 1960 return p.name, p.born`  

4.4: Retrieve all movies by testing the node label and a property.   
`match (m:Movie) where m.title = 'The Matrix' return m`  

4.5: Retrieve all people that wrote movies by testing the relationship between two nodes.  
`match (p:Person)-[rel:WROTE]->(m:Movie) return p.name, m.title`  


4.6: Retrieve all people in the graph that do not have a property.  
`match (m:Movie) where not exists (m.tagline) return m`    


4.7: Retrieve all people related to movies where the relationship has a property. 
`match(p:Person)-[rel]->(m:Movie) where exists(rel.roles) return p.name,m.title, rel.roles`
